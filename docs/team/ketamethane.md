### Project: SETA

SETA is a desktop application for CS2103T Teaching Assistants to track their students’ and tutorials’ details, and
questions asked by students, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a
Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, SETA enables you to manage your tutorials and track your students
more effectively than traditional GUI apps. Given below are my contributions to the project.
